# Word-Guess-Game

Homework assignment for the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. Create a hangman style game guessing words. This game focuses on using solely Javascript, no jQuery, for the dynamic display of elements as you go through the game. The game will randomly pick a word from a predetermined array, make sure that you only guess letters, and will only allow you to guess each letter once. The game will keep track of your wins and losses and let you restart without refreshing the page.

Working at a brewery, we had all recently taken our Cicerone Certification Exams, so beer styles were fresh on my mind. The main problem for me was, while the game is fully responsive, it doesn't have a trigger for the phone keyboard to actually guess letters. Hoping to fix that soon.
